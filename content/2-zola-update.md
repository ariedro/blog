Hi! I'm now using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

I've decided that I don't have the time or inclination to deal with CSS and
responsiveness hell that requires me to learn in order to maintain a plain
HTML page.

So now, thanks to [Enzo](https://www.enzocioppettini.com/), I'm now using
this framework that only requires me to write markdown files and it
does the rest for me.

Stay tuned for the updates with the new
[RSS feed](/atom.xml).
